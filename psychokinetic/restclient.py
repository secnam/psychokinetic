        uri (str): URI for RESTful API.
        timeout (float/tuple): How many seconds to wait for the server to send
            data before giving up, as a float, or a (connect timeout, read
            read timeout) tuple. Defaults to (2, 8) (optional)
        auth (tuple): Auth tuple to enable Basic/Digest/Custom HTTP Auth.
            ('username', 'password' ) pair.
        verify (str/bool): Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether
            we verify the server's TLS certificate, or a string, in which case
            it must be a path to a CA bundle to use. Defaults to True.

        Args:
            method (str): method for the request.
                * GET - The GET method requests a representation of the
                  specified resource. Requests using GET should only
                  retrieve data.
                * POST - The POST method is used to submit an entity to the
                  specified resource, often causing a change in state or side
                  effects on the server
                * PUT - The PUT method replaces all current representations of
                  the target resource with the request payload.
                * PATCH - The PATCH method is used to apply partial
                  modifications to a resource.
                * DELETE - The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
                * HEAD - The HEAD method asks for a response identical to
                  that of a GET request, but without the response body.
                * CONNECT - The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the
                  server identified by the target resource.
                * OPTIONS - The OPTIONS method is used to describe the
                  communication options for the target resource.
                * TRACE - The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test
                  along the path to the target resource.

            resource (str): Relative URI for the resource

            data (obj): str, dict or list to be converted to JSON.
                Otherwise sent as clear text. Objects with json method
                will be used to return json.

            headers (dict): HTTP Headers to send with the request.
            decode (bool): Decode response body as JSON where possible.

        Response body will be string unless json data is decoded either
        a list or dict will be returned.
